# **App Name**: IronLog

## Core Features:

- Custom Workout Creation: Allow users to define custom workout routines by selecting exercises and setting target sets, reps, and weight.
- Workout Logging: Enable users to log their sets, reps, and weight completed during each workout session.
- Personal Record Tracking: Automatically track and display users' personal records (PRs) for each exercise.

- Accent color: Silver (#BDBDBD) for neutral UI elements, providing a clean contrast against the dark background. This selection refers to the requested 'silver' from the user request.
